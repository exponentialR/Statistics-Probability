Question: Assume the distribution of children per family is as given in the table below:

| n_children | 0     | 1      |  2     | 3      |	4    | \>=5 |
|------------|-------| -------| -------| -------| -------|------|
|p	       | 0.3 | 0.25 |0.2| 0.15 | 0.1 | 	0   |

Consider a random girl in the population of children. What is the probability that she has a sister?

**Answer:**

The probability that a girl has a sister is equal to 
the probability that there are at least 2 children in the family, 
since a sister would be one of the children in the family. 
Therefore, the probability that a girl has a sister is equal to 

```
pr(2) + pr(3) + pr(4) + pr(>=5) 
    
= 0.2 + 0.15 + 0.1 + 0 = 0.45.```
