Question: Three ants are sitting at the three corners of an equilateral triangle. Each ant starts randomly picks a direction and starts to move along the edge of the triangle. What is the probability that none of the ants collide?

**Answer:**
The probability that none of the ants collide is 1/4.

To see this, consider a single ant. It has two options: it can either turn left or turn right. Therefore, the three ants have a total of 2^3 = 8 possible configurations of movements. Of these 8 configurations, only 4 of them result in no collisions. Therefore, the probability of no collisions is 4/8 = 1/2. However, the problem asks for the probability that no collisions occur, which is the same as the probability that at least one collision occurs. Therefore, the probability that no collisions occur is 1 - (1/2) = 1/2. Since this problem is symmetrical, this is also the probability that at least one collision occurs. Therefore, the probability that no collisions occur is 1/2.
