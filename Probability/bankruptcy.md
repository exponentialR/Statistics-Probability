Question: With some point in time T and a certain period dT, the conditional probability of company X going bankrupt between T and T+dT, given that it does not go bankrupt until T, is said to be equal to a constant K multiplied by dT. What is the probability that X goes bankrupt before T?


Company: Goldman Sachs

Answer: 
The probability that a company goes bankrupt before a certain point in time T is not equal to a constant multiplied by dT (which is a time interval). It is a probability that is either 0 (if the company has already gone bankrupt) or 1 (if the company has not yet gone bankrupt).

It is possible, however, to model the probability that a company will go bankrupt at some point in the future using a hazard function, which is a function that describes the probability that an event (in this case, bankruptcy) will occur at a given time, given that it has not yet occurred. The hazard function is often assumed to be constant over time, meaning that the probability of bankruptcy is constant over time. This is known as the constant hazard model.

Under the constant hazard model, the probability that a company will go bankrupt between time T and time T+dT, given that it has not yet gone bankrupt, is equal to a constant K multiplied by dT. However, this probability is not the same as the probability that the company will go bankrupt before time T. To find this probability, you would need to integrate the hazard function from time 0 (the beginning of the time period being considered) to time T.
