Question: If I flip a coin 100  times, and then multiply the number of heads by the number of tails, what is the expected value of that number? Can you give a confidence interval of this number?

**Answer:**
The expected value of the number of heads in 100 coin flips is 50, since the probability of getting heads in a single coin flip is 1/2. The expected value of the number of tails is also 50. Therefore, the expected value of the product of the number of heads and the number of tails is 2500 (50 x 50). It is not possible to give a confidence interval for this number, because the product of the number of heads and tails is a fixed value and not a random variable.
