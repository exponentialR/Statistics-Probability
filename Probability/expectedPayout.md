Question: You're at a casino with two dice, if you roll a 5 you win, and get paid 10.The cost of one game is 5. If you play until you win once and then stop, what is your expected income (earnings minus expenses)?

**Answer:**
The probability of rolling a 5 with two dice is 2/36 or 1/18. This means that on average it will take 18 games for you to win once. Since the cost of each game is 5, the total cost of playing 18 games is 18*5 = 90. Since you win 10 for rolling a 5, your expected income from playing until you win once and then stop is 10-90 = -80.
