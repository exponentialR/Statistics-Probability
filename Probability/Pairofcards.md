Question: What is the probability of getting a pair by drawing 2 cards in a 52 card deck?

**Answer:** 
 the probability of drawing a pair is 3/51.

To understand why, let's consider the numerator (the number of successful outcomes) and denominator (the number of total outcomes) in the probability expression.

The numerator is the number of ways to draw a pair, which is equal to the number of cards that can form a pair. There are 13 pairs in a deck of cards, and each pair has 2 cards. Therefore, there are 13 * 2 = 26 cards in total that can form a pair.

The denominator is the total number of ways to draw 2 cards from a deck of 52 cards, which is 52 * 51, since there are 52 choices for the first card and 51 choices for the second card (since after the first card is drawn, there are 51 cards left in the deck).

Therefore, the probability of drawing a pair is `26/2652 = 3/51`.
