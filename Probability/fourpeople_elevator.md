**Answer**:
There are 4! = 24 possible ways for the people to get off on different floors. For each person, there are 4 options for which floor they could get off on. Since the order in which the people get off does not matter, we divide by 4! to get the number of distinct ways that the people could get off. Therefore, the probability that each person gets off on a different floor is 1/24.
