Company: Jane Street

**Answer:**
There are a total of 2^4 = 16 possible outcomes when you flip four coins. 
There are four possibilities in which exactly three of the coins are tails: 
``TTTH, TTHT, THTT, and HTTT``. 
Therefore, the probability that exactly three of the coins are tails is `4/16 = 1/4`.
