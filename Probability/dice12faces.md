**Answer:**
In this game, the goal is to choose a number that is as close as possible to the number that is rolled on the dice. Since the dice has `12` faces, and `40%` of the time the number `12` is rolled, it makes sense to choose the number `12` if they want to maximize their chances of winning.

If the other player also chooses the number 12, then the game becomes a tie, and they will need to roll the dice again to determine the winner.

If the other player chooses a different number, then they have a higher chance of winning, since the probability of rolling the number `12` is higher than the probability of rolling any of the other numbers. The probability of rolling any of the other numbers is `60%` divided by `11`, since there are `11` other numbers besides `12` on the dice. This means that the probability of rolling any of the other numbers is about `5.45%`.

Therefore, if they want to maximize your chances of winning, they should choose the number `12`, and the other player should choose a different number.

However, the order matters. Say if the first person picks 12, then the next person could 11 in order to maximize the probability of being closer. The winning strategy would be to pick a number to either side of what the opponent picks as whichever side has the higher
