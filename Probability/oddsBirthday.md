**Answer:**

To calculate the probability of 6 people sitting around a round table in the order of their birthdays, we first need to determine the total number of possible seating arrangements. If there are 6 people, there are 6! (6 factorial) total seating arrangements, since each of the 6 people can sit in any of the 6 seats.

Then, to calculate the probability that the people will be seated in the order of their birthdays, we need to determine the number of ways that this can happen. Since the table is round, the order in which the people are seated does not matter, so there is only 1 way for the people to be seated in the order of their birthdays.

Therefore, the probability of the people being seated in the order of their birthdays is 1/6!, or 1/720. This means that the odds of this occurring are 1:720, or approximately 0.0014.
