Question: What is the probability of getting a sum of 10 if you roll a dice three times?

Company: Jane Street

**Answer:**: 
the probability of rolling a sum of 10 with three dice is 27/216. There are a total of 6^3=216 possible combinations of dice rolls when you roll three dice, and there are 27 combinations that will result in a sum of 10. These combinations are:

(4,3,3), (3,4,3), (3,3,4), (5,2,3), (5,3,2), (2,5,3), (2,3,5), (3,5,2), (3,2,5), (6,1,3), (6,3,1), (1,6,3), (1,3,6), (3,6,1), (3,1,6), (4,2,4), (4,4,2), (2,4,4), (5,1,4), (5,4,1), (1,5,4), (1,4,5), (4,5,1), (4,1,5), (2,2,6), (2,6,2), (6,2,2)

To find the probability of rolling a specific combination, you can use the formula (1/6)^3, where the exponent 3 represents the number of dice being rolled. Using this formula, you can calculate the probability of each of the 27 combinations listed above, and then add them all together to get the total probability of rolling a sum of 10 with three dice, which is `27/216`
