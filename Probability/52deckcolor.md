Question: What is the probability of pulling a different color or shape card from a shuffled deck of 52 cards?

**Answer:**
There are 52 cards in a deck, and there are 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs) and 13 ranks (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace) in a deck of cards. If you pull a card at random from a shuffled deck, the probability of getting a card that is a different color or shape (suit) from the one you previously drew is 51/52, which is approximately 0.98. This is because there are 51 cards remaining in the deck after you draw one card, and 52 total cards in the deck.
