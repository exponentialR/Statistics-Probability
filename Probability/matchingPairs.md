Question: 
You have a drawer with an infinite number of socks of two colors, which exist with equal probability. What is the expected number of attempts of taking out individual socks before a matching pair is found?

Company: Jane Street

**Answer:**
To find the expected number of attempts, we can think about it this way: the probability of success on the first attempt is 1/2, and the probability of failure is 1/2. If the first attempt is a failure, then we have to try again, and the probability of success on the second attempt is also 1/2. Therefore, the expected number of attempts is 1 * (1/2) + 2 * (1/2) = 2.5.
