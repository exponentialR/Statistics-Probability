Question: Imagine I flip a coin 100 times in a sequence, and you need to guess the sequence. You are allowed to ask one yes/no question. What do you ask to maximize the probability of guessing the correct sequence?

**Answer:**
A good question to ask would be: "Is the number of heads in the sequence greater than 50?" This question gives you the most information about the sequence and allows you to narrow down the possible sequences. If the answer is "yes," then you know that there are more heads than tails in the sequence, and if the answer is "no," then you know that there are fewer heads than tails or an equal number of heads and tails. This information allows you to eliminate half of the possible sequences, increasing your chances of guessing the correct one.
