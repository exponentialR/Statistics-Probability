**Answer:**
The probability of getting at least one 4 with 2 dice is `11/36`. To see this, we can compute the probability of not getting a 4 with either dice, which is `(5/6)^2=25/36`, and then subtract this from 1 to get the probability of getting at least one 4, which is `1 - 25/36 = 11/36`.

For n dice, the probability of getting at least one 4 is `1 - (5/6)^n`. This is because the probability of not getting a 4 with any of the dice is (5/6)^n, and the probability of getting at least one 4 is 1 minus this probability.
