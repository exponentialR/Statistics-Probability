Question:

Company: Jane Street

**Answer:**
The probability of obtaining 2 tails in 5 coin flips is `(5 choose 2) * (1/2)^5`, which is equal to `(5*4)/(2*1) * (1/32)`, or approximately `0.3125`. 
This is because there are (5 choose 2) ways to choose which 2 flips result in tails, and the probability of getting a tail on each of those flips is 1/2. The probability of getting a head on the other flips is also 1/2.
One way to obtain 2 tails in 5 flips is TTHTT, and another way is THTTH. There are a total of (5 choose 2) = 10 ways to obtain 2 tails in 5 flips.
