Question: Consider a game with 2 players, A and B. Player A has 8 stones, player B has 6. Game proceeds as follows. First, A rolls a fair 6-sided die, and the number on the die determines how many stones A takes over from B. Next, B rolls the same die, and the exact same thing happens in reverse. This concludes the round. Whoever has more stones at the end of the round wins and the game is over. If players end up with equal # of stones at the end of the round, it is a tie and another round ensues. What is the probability that B wins in 1, 2, ..., n rounds?

**Answer:**:
In order for B to win in one round, the following must happen:

A must roll a 1, 2, or 3 on their turn.
B must roll a 4, 5, or 6 on their turn.
The probability of this occurring is (3/6) * (3/6) = 1/4.

However, there is also a probability that the game will end in a tie, in which case another round will be played. The probability of a tie occurring is (2/6) * (2/6) = 4/36. Therefore, the total probability of B winning in one round or the game ending in a tie is 1/4 + 4/36 = 10/36.

For B to win in two rounds, the following must happen:

A must roll a 1, 2, or 3 on their turn in the first round.
B must roll a 1, 2, or 3 on their turn in the first round.
A must roll a 1, 2, or 3 on their turn in the second round.
B must roll a 4, 5, or 6 on their turn in the second round.
The probability of this occurring is (3/6) * (3/6) * (3/6) * (3/6) = 1/16.

However, there is also a probability that the game will end in a tie after one round, in which case another round will be played. The probability of a tie occurring after one round is 4/36. Therefore, the total probability of B winning in two rounds or the game ending in a tie after one round is 1/16 + 4/36 * 15/36 = 75/1296.

Here is the formula for the probability that B wins in n rounds:

P(B wins in n rounds) = `5/36 * (6/36)^(n-2) * 15/36`

This formula takes into account the probability that A rolls a 1, 2, or 3 on their turn in each round, and that B rolls a 4, 5, or 6 on their turn in each round. It also takes into account the probability that the game will end in a tie after one round, which is 4/36, and the probability that the game will end in a tie after two rounds, which is (2/36)^2 = 4/1296. These probabilities are multiplied together to give the total probability of B winning in n rounds.
