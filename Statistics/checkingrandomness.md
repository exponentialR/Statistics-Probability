Question: In an A/B test, how can you check if assignment to the various buckets was truly random?

Company: Amazon

**Answer:**

There are several ways to check if assignment to the various buckets in an A/B test was truly random:

`1.` Check the distribution of the sample: truly random assignment must be characterised by equal sample distribution across the population.

`2.` Conduct a chi-square test: his is a statistical test that can be used to determine if the observed distribution of the sample differs significantly from the expected distribution.

`3.` Check for biases: The absence of bias most likely typify randomness.

`4.` Use a randomization test.

`5.` Use a blocking design.
