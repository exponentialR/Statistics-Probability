Question: What is a p-value? Would your interpretation of p-value change if you had a different (much bigger, 3 mil records for ex.) data set?

**Answer:**
A p-value is a statistical measure that is used to asses the strength of evidence in a statistical hypothesis test. It is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed  in the data, given that the null hypothesis is true.

In other words, a p-value helps determine whether the results of a study are statistically significant, or whether they could have happened by chance.
If the p-value is low (usually less than 0.05), it means that the results are unlikely to have happened by chance, and you can reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis. If the p-value is high, it means that the results could have happened by chance, and you cannot reject the null hypothesis.

The interpretation of the p-value would not change if you had a larger dataset. However, a larger sample size can sometimes make it easier to reject the null hypothesis because you have more data to work with and the power of test may increase. This means that it may be more likely that you will be able to detect a difference between the groups if one exists.
