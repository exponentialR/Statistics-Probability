Question: What is the expectation of the variance?

Company: Meta

**Answer:**
The expected value of the variance of a random variable is the variance of the random variable itself. In other words, if we have a random variable `X` with Variance `Var(x)`, then the expected value of `Var(x)` is equal to `Var(x)`.

This can be expressed as

`E[Var(x)] = Var(x)`

This relationship holds because the variance of a random variable is the measure of dispersion or spread of the values that the variable can take, and the expected value is a measure of the center of the distribution of the variable. As a result the the expected value of the variance will be equal to the variance itself.
