**Answer:**
If you take the mean and median age of a group of people in Mexico, it is possible for either the mean or the median to be higher, depending on the specific ages of the people in the group.

The mean is the average age of a group of people, calculated by adding together all the ages and dividing the total by the number of people. The median is the middle value when a group of numbers is ordered from least to greatest.

If the ages of the people in the group are evenly distributed around the mean, with roughly the same number of people above and below the mean, then the mean and median will be close to each other in value and either one could be higher.

However, if the ages of the people in the group are not evenly distributed, and there are more people with ages either much higher or much lower than the mean, then the mean and median could be quite different. In this case, the mean could be pulled away from the median either up or down, depending on which direction the ages are skewed.

For example, if the ages of the people in the group were `[20, 30, 40, 50, 60]`, the mean age would be `40` and the median age would also be `40`, since the middle value (when the ages are ordered from least to greatest) is also 40. In this case, the mean and median would be equal.

On the other hand, if the ages of the people in the group were `[20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]`, the mean age would still be `40`, but the median age would be `45` (the middle value when the ages are ordered from least to greatest). In this case, the median would be higher than the mean.
