Question: There are 100 products and 25 of them are bad. What is the confidence interval?

Company: Tesla

**Answer:**
A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population proportion, with a certain level of confidence. It is used to estimate the value of a population parameter based on a sample. The confidence level is the probability that the confidence interval will contain the true population proportion.

For example, let's say you are interested in estimating the proportion of defective products in a factory. You take a sample of 100 products and find that 25 of them are defective. You can use this sample to calculate a confidence interval for the true proportion of defective products in the population.

To do this, you first need to determine the sample size (100 products) and the sample proportion of defective products (25/100 = 0.25). Then, you can use these values to calculate the confidence interval using the following formula:

`confidence interval = sample proportion ± margin of error
`
The margin of error is a measure of the precision of the estimate. It is calculated as:

`margin of error = critical value * standard error
`
The critical value depends on the confidence level that you want to use. For example, if you want to use a 95% confidence level, the critical value is `1.96`. If you want to use a 90% confidence level, the critical value is `1.645`.

The standard error is a measure of the variability in the sampling distribution of the sample proportion. It is calculated as:

`standard error = √(sample proportion * (1 - sample proportion) / sample size)
`
Plugging these values into the formula for the margin of error, we get:

`margin of error = critical value * √(sample proportion * (1 - sample proportion) / sample size)
`
So, to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of defective products in the population, you would use the following formula:

`confidence interval = sample proportion ± 1.96 * √(sample proportion * (1 - sample proportion) / sample size)
`
Plugging in the values from this example, the 95% confidence interval would be:

```
confidence interval = 0.25 ± 1.96 * √(0.25 * (1 - 0.25) / 100)

= 0.25 ± 0.05

= (0.20, 0.30)```

This means that you can be 95% confident that the true proportion of defective products in the population is between 20% and 30%.
