Question: What is meant by Maximum Likelihood Estimation?

Company: Goldman Sachs

**Answer:**
Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method used to estimate the parameters of a statistical model, given some observed data. The goal of MLE is to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function, which represents the probability of the observed data occurring given the parameter values. MLE is a popular method for estimating the parameters of a distribution because it is simple to implement and has desirable statistical properties. It is often used in machine learning and other fields to estimate the parameters of statistical models, such as linear regression and logistic regression.
