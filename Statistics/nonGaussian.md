Question: What is an example of a dataset with a non-Gaussian distribution?


Company: IBM

**Answer:**
An example of a dataset that may have a non-Gaussian distribution is one that represents the heights of students in a school. The heights of students in a school may be distributed in a bell curve, with most students having heights that are average and fewer students having either very short or very tall heights. However, the distribution of student heights is not always a perfect bell curve and may be skewed or have outliers, which would make it a non-Gaussian distribution. Other examples of datasets with non-Gaussian distributions include data on income, test scores, and the sizes of natural disasters.
